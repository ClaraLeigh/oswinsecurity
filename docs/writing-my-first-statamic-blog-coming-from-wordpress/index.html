                <p>Hello friend, welcome to my first ever statamic blog.</p><p>Installing statamic was a breeze, I installed the global composer package and started the install process. First up, it asked about a starter kit, to which I naturally said yes. After a quick search, I landed on <a target="_blank" href="https://statamic.com/starter-kits/statamic/starters-creek" title="Starters Creek, a statamic starter kit">Starter&#039;s Creek</a>. It seemed simple and a little quirky, which is just my style.</p><p><img src="/assets/first-blog/image_2024-09-29_135036656.png">Next up, it asked about installing addons, and I immediately chose the static site generator. I figure a security focused blog should probably be static html and cheap to host, which I should be able to do with GitHub Pages and Cloudflare.</p><p>Everything wrapped up quickly after a few more basic questions, like whether I wanted a super user etc.</p><p>Now I was ready to jump in!</p><p>Logging in was next and immediately I notice something not quite right in the main menu.</p><p><img src="/assets/first-blog/image_2024-09-29_135131314.png">The duplicate IDs menu item looked wrong, clearly an icon is missing and the alt text was overlaying other text making it hard to read.</p><p>Okay, okay, one bug so far, thats not too bad but I did think that this would be perfect out of the box from how it was talked about.</p><p>Next up its time to write a blog, so I think of a cool title, I look up some banner images and go to insert it. <br>Whoops, &quot;<strong>This field is required</strong>&quot;, pops up after uploading a file.</p><p>What field you ask? Well lets open the developer tools, go to the network tab and look for an error. There is a 422 error on the assets endpoint, with the following response:</p>
            
        
            
<pre class="language-php rounded"><code>```json
{
    "message": "The given data was invalid.",
    "errors": {
        "folder": [
            "This field is required."
        ]
    }
}
```</code></pre>
            
        
            
                <p>It appears that a folder is required, which is odd because I wasnâ€™t prompted to select one, nor was there an option available.</p><p>Okay, I open the asset manager in the left menu and then I can see all the files, including a folder button. I even managed to upload the banner image here, as I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll return to that blog later.</p><p>Now I re-open the blog creation page.... and I can&#039;t see the folder or the image I uploaded. Something is still wrong and image upload still gets the same 422 error.</p><p>Back to assets, let&#039;s look around, I see a &quot;Create Container&quot; button. Clicking on it, it seems to be a page where I can store images and choose a filesystem, etc. Okay, this must be it, lets create one of these bad bois.</p><p><img src="/assets/first-blog/screenshot-2024-09-29-at-12.59.22 pm.png">I go back into create my blog and try again, but I see no collection when I open browse, just the same few images that come default with the starter kit.</p><p>Feeling a bit frustrated, I decided to try uploading the image directly to the main folder within Assets.</p><p>I upload what the picture in assets, return to the blog and tada! I can select the image and use it as my banner image ðŸ¥³</p><p>Now, naturally I&#039;ve decided to go in a different direction with my first blog, lets talk about my first blog writing experience coming from WordPress. There was a lot of drama in the WP community this week so I thought it best to keep away from that world this time around.</p><p>Typing this up, I started to realize things werenâ€™t quite right, I need code tags for the response example but it appears that there is no built in way to add that. Looking around I realise I&#039;m in the wrong field! I&#039;m sitting in the intro, typing out my blog, missing all the core functionality. Thatâ€™s okay, it was my mistake for not scrolling down the page and noticing more options beneath the hero image.</p><p>I move down and instantly typing is 100x better. Code blocks work, but it seems to be missing a json option out of the box, so I select json and do my codeblock the old fashioned way, yet looking on the frontend, it shows up with the text &quot;PHP&quot; ðŸ™„ okay so thats not the best, but I don&#039;t care too much for this sort of blog.</p><p>Now let&#039;s review the experience so far.</p><h3>What was better than WordPress?</h3><ul><li><p><strong>The framework</strong>, it&#039;s built on Laravel, which instantly wins me over</p></li><li><p><strong>The install</strong>, I like the terminal install, very dev friendly</p></li><li><p><strong>The community</strong>, I have met many a Statamic advocate and all of them are the friendliest people in the world</p></li><li><p><strong>It supports a static site!</strong> Hell yes, no vulnerabilities in the framework for me</p></li><li><p><strong>I can host for free?!?!</strong> Yep, all I need is GitHub and Cloudflare</p></li></ul><h3>Areas for Improvement in Statamic</h3><ul><li><p><strong>First impressions</strong>. WordPress has this beat by far.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bugs</strong>, there was so many just getting started that I nearly gave up</p></li><li><p><strong>UX</strong>, it feels like the early days in WP, like it was built by devs for devs, at least in the backend</p></li><li><p><strong>The install</strong>, it needs the 5min UI install that made WP famous</p></li><li><p><strong>Less is more</strong>, there is slightly too many things that I feel the need to learn, which WordPress hides by default. I&#039;m sure it will come with time but at a first look, there are things everywhere that don&#039;t have easy explanations. I&#039;m sure I&#039;m about to spend a lot of time in the documentation, something I enjoy but others might not</p></li></ul><h3>Where to from here?</h3><p>Well I am going to start writing some security blogs. This was just my first piece out the door and I used it as a learning experience. I&#039;ll likely write about my time studying for the OSCP and OSEP, why I got into security, the first time I got in trouble for hacking, and the one time I pulled a 72hr shift at work because of a security issue.</p><h3>Wait, what about the WordPress drama, can you post some tea?</h3><p>I started using WordPress back in high school, I actually got my first job in industry using it. I built three or more WordPress sites for the local environmental council, and was even paid a little for it! Paid working for a non profit helping the environment, it was a really sweet first job. Here is what the site looked like, please don&#039;t judge me ðŸ™ˆ<br><img src="/assets/first-blog/image_2024-09-29_141144483.png">It was meant to be a tree with wood carved out for the posts. There was a banner image too and the pacing was slightly better but the way back machine has a pretty close copy of what it looked like.</p><p>At the time, I looked in on the WordPress core and saw a bunch of really nice friendly devs and the leader, Matt Mullenweg. He seemed quite excited that people were using WP and wanted to make it grow. He was a little controlling and made some poor design decisions security wise so I kept my distance. I didn&#039;t really want to have to fight for my ideas like I saw some doing.</p><p>My next major open source platform I used was OpenCart, and the guy running that was about 10x worse. This confirmed my bias that working in open source was essentially inviting drama into my life. Something I didn&#039;t really want, so naturally I stayed clear (I was wrong but more on that later).</p><p>Following WordPress over the years, I&#039;ve seen my suspicions about Matt M get reconfirmed multiple times. I saw him sue people and threaten them over small things, only to loose in court. I watched Gutenberg be a mess and witnessed more captains calls around it&#039;s release that upset people for no real reason. </p><p>Recently, he went on the offensive against WP Engine, which did not surprise me. If anything I was surprised that it happened now, not years ago. </p><p><strong>Does he have a point? </strong>Yes, I agree that WPE could give back a lot more. I think that they should be part of the core team and be a top core contributor.</p><p><strong>Did he mess up with how he approached it? </strong>Yes, I think it proves that he&#039;s too attached to run WordPress or be a big part of leadership. I thank him for everything he&#039;s done but please step down and let the community recover. Sure, contribute as much as you want, but let someone else make the calls. Advise them if need be, but the community&#039;s trust has been betrayed and it&#039;s time to step back. </p><p>Also, if you don&#039;t have clear, easy ways to let people mirror everything, then don&#039;t force it upon 200k+ websites. Attacking WPEngine isn&#039;t just attacking one person, it&#039;s attacking me as one of their thousands of users and that is why the betrayal hurts so much. 15 years of my life using WordPress and he&#039;s just pulled my core updates, plugin installs and other feature&#039;s over a spat with my hosting company. Sure it&#039;s been returned <strong>for the weekend</strong>, I just hope I don&#039;t loose more time to his emotions. Could you imagine the comments and headlines if a woman did this? I&#039;d have to avoid the internet for weeks, the tech bros would be going off.</p><h3>Will I contribute to Open Source in the future?</h3><p>Hell yes, I&#039;ve been using Laravel for 10 years now and they are the best community I&#039;ve been apart of. It&#039;s never had the problems that WordPress had and continues to have. </p><p>I have started giving back lately with some small security based feedback to websites and packages. I even spent a little time on a open source project called LibreChat, I even coined the name when I threw it out as an option. Unfortunately I got a bit distracted with study for my OSCP last year, so I dropped off soon after, but I still use it daily and jump in if I see something wrong.</p><p>I have also learnt a lot of the Laravel core framework and have done a small contribution to Pest in recent times, all to help give back. I even started giving some small donations on GitHub, just what I can afford for now. Shout out to Saloon PHP, you have saved me so much time this past year.</p><p>I also hope to focus on improving security online, improving my own knowledge and possibly share anything neat I learn along the way.</p><p>Speaking of security, if you are after a neat security blog, check out <a href="https://securinglaravel.com/">https://securinglaravel.com/</a><br>Definitely relevant to the Laravel world, if thats the space you&#039;re in.</p><p>I&#039;ll see you soon in my next blog, which will likely be on my security journey so far ðŸ¥· </p>
